# Sensor
Sensor is built using the win32 API, the test for sensor folder is an example use of sensor, but this is NOT PRACTICAL and is just a learning experiance for me to learn (slightly) advanced c++
PLEASE NOTE: Dont ever use the win32 API for a super quick project (like a game) it's way to slow. Spare yourself the pain
